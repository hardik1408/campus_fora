This project is about building a webpage using react js framework along with html, css and javascript. 
I first installed node js framework and then used itto create a basic react app. Then taking reference from Bootstrap, i created variuos elements for my webpage such as 
carousel,scrollspy etc.
I made a navbar and a search bar. Also i made two butttons, seacrh and login.

I used css for styling and font styles. App.css contains all css styling
App.js is the main javascript which contains code to all the components. 
index.html contains the basic framework of the page. I have added a photo of iitk as the icon in the taskbar.
