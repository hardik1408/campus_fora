This project is about building a webpage using react js framework along with html, css and javascript. 
I first installed node js framework and then used itto create a basic react app. Then taking reference from Bootstrap, i created variuos elements for my webpage such as 
carousel,scrollspy etc.
I made a navbar and a search bar. Also i made two butttons, seacrh and login.
